        <h2>History of Bitcoin</h2>
        <p>Bitcoin was developed at the peak of the global financial crisis in 2008 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. It was launched officially in January 2009. The first Bitcoin transaction was worth 10 BTC that Satoshi Nakamoto sent to Hal Finney, a developer and early Bitcoin adopter.
            At its launch, Bitcoin’s value was almost negligible. It was more than a year later, in July 2010, that its price shot from US$0.0008 to US$0.08 per BTC. In the last ten years, Bitcoin’s price has increased by thousands of times. In December 2020, Bitcoin hit its all-time high of US$27,000.</p>
